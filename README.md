## Learning Goals

## Project Overview

  In this project I used Test Driving Development to create a set of flashcards that can be answered in the Terminal. When `node index.js` is called in the terminal a new game in started. A game class is created with a deck of cards that each have a question, a list of possible answers, a correct answer and an id. Once you have completed all of the questions, the percent of questions you got correct will be displayed and the program will end.
