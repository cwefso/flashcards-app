  A tool for testing your useless knowledge with flashcards.

### Creator:
  - Charles Wefso (GitHub: [CWefso](https://github.com/cwefso))

## Learning Goals

  - Make a project that runs purely in the console.
  - TDD.
  - Writing tests and familiarity with Mocha/Chai
  - Gain deeper understanding of objects, classes and how the interact.

## Install Instruction 

  To install, simply clone the repo into a local directory and run `node index.js` to begin the game.

## Project Overview

  In this project I used Test Driving Development to create a set of flashcards that can be answered in the Terminal. When `node index.js` is called in the terminal a new game in started. A game class is created with a deck of cards that each have a question, a list of possible answers, a correct answer and an id. Once you have completed all of the questions, the percent of questions you got correct will be displayed and the program will end.
